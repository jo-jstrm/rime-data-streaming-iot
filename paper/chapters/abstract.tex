% The advent of IoT and the age of billions of sensors has lead to
% data pipelines pushing computation to mobile nodes, as close to the data sources
% as possible. To this end, mobile nodes in a network can enter 
% or leave a system from any place and at any point in time.
% Therefore, IoT data management systems have to embrace frequent failures, 
% partial disconnections, network partitions, and a highly volatile topology
%  as the norm. 
% The need to exploit
% ad-hoc as well as stationary resources leads to the problem
% of keeping up with a volatile topology without harming system performance.
The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the usage of resources at the
edge of the network for various data management tasks that are traditionally executed in the cloud.
However, the heterogeneity of devices and communication methods in a multi-tiered
IoT environment (cloud/fog/edge) exacerbates the problem of deciding \textit{which} nodes to use for processing and \textit{how} to route  data.
% 
In addition, both decisions cannot be made only statically for the entire lifetime of an application, as an IoT environment is highly dynamic and nodes in the same topology can be both stationary and mobile as well as reliable and volatile.
%
As a result of these different characteristics, an IoT data management system that spans across all tiers of an IoT network cannot meet the same availability assumptions for all its nodes.
% 
To address the problem of choosing ad-hoc which nodes to use and include in a processing workload, 
we propose a networking component that uses a-priori as well as ad-hoc routing 
information from the network. 
Our approach, called Rime, relies on keeping track of nodes at the gateway level 
and exchanging routing information with other nodes in the network.
% 
By tracking nodes while the topology evolves in a geo-distributed 
manner, we enable efficient communication even in the case of frequent node failures.
Our evaluation shows that Rime keeps in check communication costs and message transmissions 
by reducing unnecessary message exchange by up to $82.65\%$.

% Concretely, In this paper we present Rime, our approach to handling an IoT topology. 
% Rime is a system component that tracks children and parent nodes in a federated 
% manner while the topology evolves. With Rime, we enable efficient 
% data routing even in the case of frequent failures.
% Our evaluation shows that Rime keeps in check communication costs and message transmissions 
% by reducing unnecessary message exchange by up to $82.65\%$.
